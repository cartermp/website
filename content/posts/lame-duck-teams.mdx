One of the fun aspects of going from a big tech company to a startup to a big tech company again is really seeing how differently they treat teams.

One of the big tech phenomenon I've noticed is a [Lame Duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lame_duck_%28politics%29) team that someone in management has already decided is going to be dismantled, but there's still plenty of work to be done, and so they just keep the team going for a while, often without a plan for when they actually wind down.

This term is perhaps a misnomer, as it's not quite the same thing as the political term, but it's the best I could come up with right now. Some signs you're on a Lame Duck team:

- No clear vision for what comes a few quarters from now
- Mostly just "completing the work" or "rounding out features"
- Weird organizational spot with maybe a director as your manager or some other manager doing you part-time
- Other people like PMs "stretched too thin" to come up with a roadmap for you
- Little to no support from other parts of the business
- No significant presence on any materials for customers or internal teams

These are all strong signs that your team is going to be wound down. Eventually.

See, the thing that's really funny about big tech and these teams is that they go on for a lot longer than they should. In a startup, there isn't enough time to fuck around with 3-5 (or more) people plodding along on work that's already served its purpose. You disassemble and move on because time is your most precious currency. But in bigger tech companies, you have loads of time, or you're just in an org with a stupendous amount of waste and your "wasted money" or whatever is just a drop in the bucket that you're not a priority to disassemble right now.

Granted, this sort of stuff probably also happens in some startups, too. One of the dirtier secrets of startups is that they can also be ridden with politics, bloated orgs, and all the other stuff you'd normally attribute to a big tech company.

Anyways, this is one of the things that startup world hates about big tech, and one example of why people who have ever only worked in big tech get confused about why a bunch of startup people look down on them. But hey, the money's usually good.
