My wife and I are expecting our first child imminently, and it's exciting but also perhaps a little scary. *Something I noticed in this time is that there's shockingly little content by men, for men, about supporting their pregnant partners over the course of months of immense change*. It's not that the content doesn't exist, it's just that there's so little of it that it might as well not exist.

So here's a small, incomplete, unordered list of things I think were helpful in the moment and fulfilling in retrospect.

1. Read about midwifery and how [broken the US hospital system is for pregnancy and birth](https://www.bu.edu/sph/news/articles/2023/average-pregnancy-length-in-the-us-is-shorter-than-in-european-countries/)
2. Read about how each phase of pregnancy can affect your partner's body and adapt your behavior based on what you see with your own eyes
3. Morning sickness isn't just in the morning (in fact, it can be evening sickness for some!)
4. Chances are, your dad or grandpa or uncle or whatever has no actual advice to give, since they came from a time where pregnancies are "out of sight, out of mind" for other men
5. Reddit communities are filled primarily with men taking pictures with their newborn claiming how they're "so happy" instead of actual advice. It sucks.
6. Reddit has private communities called "bump groups". Encourage your partner to join one and be content with them spending time on there privately.
7. Bump group communities are filled with stories where birthing partners are at their wit's end because _their_ partners haven't changed anything about their behavior during pregnancy. Don't be one of those partners who gets complained about privately online!
8. Create a list of weekly chores that you should solely do, set a reminder for the weekend, and burn through them all each week. It's okay if you don't get to everything on busy weeks and weekends.
9. Sit down with your partner and ask them what the top things you could take off their plate are. Figure out a plan to take those things off their plate!
10. A lot of people work long hours and that makes it hard for them to provide good support.
11. The apps telling you how big your baby is on a fruit scale are stupid. Don't give money to them.
12. Read Penny Simkin's [The Birth Partner](https://www.amazon.com/Birth-Partner-Sixth-Revised-Childbirth/dp/0760393230/), or at least skim the TL;DR sections
13. The Affordable Care Act entitles you to a free breast pump and other resources, so don't spend money unnecessarily.
14. Hire a birth doula. Hire a birth doula. Hire a birth doula.
15. Find ways to get your partner out of the house and encourage them to spend time _offline_.
16. You *almost never need to buy the gadget*, whatever it is. There is a big industry out there preying on the hormonal changes of pregnant people and using that to get them to buy a bunch of crap.
17. Proactively read or at least skim a few of the books your partner has undoubedtly also been reading.
18. Start lifting some weights. Seriously! Get stronger! As pregnancy progresses you will eventually need to be able to support your partner's body for a long period of time. Don't want you back to give out? Start doing squats and deadlifts.
19. Put together a list of places you'd like to go eat out, and burn through the list.
20. Don't feel inadequate just because you're not thinking about baby stuff 24/7 the way your partner is. They have hormonal changes forcing their brain to do that -- you don't.
21. Sign up for [Daddy Bootcamp](https://daddybootcamp.net/) and have your partner do the corresponding one for birthing partners.
22. Read about miscarriages and learn about how painful they can be and how the observed miscarriage rates are a lot higher than official statistics. Chances are most people or everyone in your social circle have experiences at least one.

I guess my last one is to just be flexible. You might have a demanding schedule that makes it harder to participate in things, or your partner's pregnancy could be going in all kinds of ways that no books or online resources help with. Just be present as much as you can.
