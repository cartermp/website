title: About Me
---

In my day job, I’m a Principal PM at Honeycomb, where I lead our AI efforts. Prior to this, I drove Honeycomb's telemetry pipeline, OpenTelemetry story, and API. I also worked on the .NET team at Microsoft for 6 years.

I’m also a maintainer in the OpenTelemetry project, primarily focusing on the website. I do occasionally send PRs to other parts of the project, though.
